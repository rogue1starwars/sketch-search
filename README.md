# Sketch Search

## What is Sketch Search?

Sketch Search is a reference-search desktop application for anyone who creates content.

It uses a custom fine-tuned Yolo v8 Pose model to estimate poses on any given image and returns a similar reference. It runs fully on the client side, and no data will be uploaded.

## Usage

Upload any reference data you want using the upload button. These are the images that show up when you actually search for references. PNG and JPG files are allowed.

When you want to search a reference for a specific image, (for example, a sketch of an illustration that you are working on) click the search button. The machine learning model will estimate the pose of the given image and return a reference image (The image you uploaded above) that is close to the given one.
